Lore/Story Notes:

A Dovahkiin has the ability to absorb the souls of dead dragons and fragments of the souls of mortals. Dovahdiin has the ability to manipulate the accumulated power of absorbed souls/fragments.

While a dovahkiin is a mortal favored by Akatosh Dovahdiin is different in nature, she is an entity given life by Akatosh, once a mortal Dovahkiin and devoted priestess of Akatosh. As she passed she offered her body as an empty vessel to use, Akatosh breathed immortal life back into the body and the new entity, Dovahdiin has served each Favored since, most of whom have been Dovahkiin, helping them to grow into immensely powerful beings in most cases.

The level area is the tomb of the deceased priestess whose body is now Dovahdiin. Akatosh has severed it from mundus and sealed it to all but his favored champions, collectively the “Favored”..

Respawn lore; those Akatosh favors are granted divine intervention, preventing them from an untimely death. The favored are removed from time and are permitted to travel back to Mundus at a time before their death. Influencing the events of Mundus from Aetherius is not precise. The favored may find themselves moments before their would-be demise or several minutes before, on-top of this only the Favored’s own soul and physical possessions may travel with them, their gathered experience/souls remain behind in Mundus and are able to be reclaimed should the Favored reach them without any further disruptions to the passage of time.

The large fire in the room is a dragonfire and the mechanism by which the plane is sealed from mundus and other realms.

After acquiring several Dragon souls or any unique boss soul fragment the dragonfire will change, becoming the station where the player can make exchanges. Dovahdiin will offer two explanations based on the player status as dovahkiin.

Dovahdiin is one entity that exists in parallel to other instances of herself that served previous Favored, she has no memory of those before her because they exist in parallel.

Dovahdiin has existed since before the life of Tiber Septim but after Miraak (the first Dovahkiin), because of the nature of her isolated existence she does not have a normal understanding of the passage of time and consequences of it.

Hint that she has existed since the time of the covenant between St Alessia and Akatosh, perhaps she's even linked to that event.

Over the course of the player’s progression both through levels and Skyrim’s various stories Dovahkiin will remember details about the nature of her existence as well as further details about the Favored.

Given that she is not aware of the mortal realm and it’s faiths she never refers to Akatosh by mortal deity names, after remembering her role as Dovahdiin she may at points refer to Borhami, “my father” in the dragon tongue.

Dovahdiin is fluent in the dragon tongue and may occasionally mingle with common.


How do we introduce the level space and mechanics?

We could do a souls style forced death encounter? Maybe make an impossibly difficult enemy hunt the player down in the wilderness once they cross an XP threshold, if they haven’t already died previously.
Perhaps we do this and have Dovahdiin grant the player their lost XP back as a one-time gesture, so they can be introduced to the space while being able to level up.
We could also give the player a dialogue option to disable the respawn mechanic starting here. (“I don’t want you to interfere with my end.”, let them turn it back on with a dialogue option too, we can just turn off the death handle script entirely here though we’d have to rehouse it in it’s own quest to do that.)

Dialogue needs to be corney old-timey in a very “from soft” way, partly to crib on their style but also to instill the idea that this character is of a much different time and nature than the rest of Tamriel.
